# deminer
Deminer is a basic Minesweeper game that runs in the terminal window. [It was written using a tutorial.]

Deminer was written in Python by 3y3l3ss0ur0b0r0s on 03/18/2022 using [Kylie Ying's tutorial](https://youtu.be/Fjw7Lc9zlyU).

It allows the user to do the following:
1. View an updated Minesweeper board before each turn.
2. Choose where to "dig", and win or lose the game based on their decisions.
